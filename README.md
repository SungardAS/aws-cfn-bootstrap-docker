# docker-aws-cfn-bootstrap

Bootstrap AWS ec2 with CloudFormation and Docker

## Summary

The host is requried to have docker installed.  This can be done
with `UserData` either through a `cloud-init` definition or a shell
script.

Once docker is available this image can be run with:

    docker run \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
      -e [AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=] -e [CFN_METADATA_RESOURCE=] -e ...
      sungardas/aws-cfn-bootstrap

The container will interface with CloudFormation, can access
CloudFormation Metadata and is able to respond to a `CreationPolicy` or
`WaitCondition`.

Useful for implementations that only run Docker containers and for
minimal operating systems like
[rancheros](https://github.com/rancher/os)

In CloudFormation metadata all commands can be calls to docker.  All
images will be pulled and run by the host docker engine.

## Docker Version

This project creates tags for different versions of docker.  Use a tag
that matches the version of docker the host is running.

    sungardas/aws-cfn-bootstrap:1.10
    sungardas/aws-cfn-bootstrap:1.11


## Available Commands

## Environment Variables

`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` - The AWS region to run against.

`CFN_CONFIG_SETS` - List of config sets to run.

`CFN_METADATA_RESOURCE` - The resource containing `AWS::CloudFormation::Init`

`CFN_NOTIFY_RESOURCE` - The resource to send notification to when
complete. Usually one with `CreationPolicy` defined.
